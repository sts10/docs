# Notes on Debian

## Notes from that sort-of-random Lenny YouTube Video

This video, despite title, is pretty helpful! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phormMkBl60

### Assuming I want the Testing/"Stretch" Version

"Testing" is between "stable" and "unstable" (source: https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-ftparchives#s-testing), and generally a pretty good balance?

### Let's Download Debian Stretch

From this page (referenced in that video): https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/

I was sent over to this page: https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/

I think I want to go under "Official release" > CD > amd64 , which takes me to : http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/stretch_di_rc3/amd64/iso-cd/ 

From there I think I'd download: "debian-stretch-DI-rc3-amd64-xfce-CD-1.iso   2017-04-09 04:02  633M" 

Though if I didn't want Xfce, I'd get the "netinst" version (which stands for net install), which would let me choose my DE on install and then it downloads theDE then.


Once I have the ISO on my hard drive, I believe I could insert a USB stick and burn the ISO on there with "Startup Disk Creator" 

- During install, your wifi probably won't work; so you'd want to be connected via ethernet
- You want to choose the Graphical install (64-bit I assume)
