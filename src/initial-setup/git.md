# Git

Before you do anything else, especially with Neovim or Vim, install git! `sudo apt install git`

Given the holistic setup in this document, you're going to want to use the ssh URL when cloning down repos from GitHub (as opposed to HTTPS).

## Optional: Set a global gitignore

On Kubuntu, I've gotten by without a global gitignore file, but if you want to make one, I think this is the procedure I'd follow: 

1. Run `git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global` or something similar ([source](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/ignoring-files#create-a-global-gitignore)). Or, I think you can put in `~/.config/.gitignore_global` if your prefer.

2. Visit [gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io) and generate yourself a recommended global gitignore file, given your preferred languages, code editor, and OS. For example, here's [one for writing Rust, Python, and Ruby in Vim on Linux](https://www.gitignore.io/api/vim,ruby,rust,linux):

```txt

### Linux ###

# temporary files which can be created if a process still has a handle open of a deleted file
.fuse_hidden*

# KDE directory preferences
.directory

# Linux trash folder which might appear on any partition or disk
.Trash-*

# .nfs files are created when an open file is removed but is still being accessed
.nfs*

#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
