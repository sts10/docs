# Git

Before you do anything else, especially with Neovim or Vim, install git! `sudo apt install git`

Given the holistic setup in this document, you're going to want to use the ssh URL when cloning down repos from GitHub (as opposed to HTTPS).

## Optional: Set a global gitignore

On Kubuntu, I've gotten by without a global gitignore file, but if you want to make one, I think this is the procedure I'd follow: 

1. Run `git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global` or something similar ([source](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/ignoring-files#create-a-global-gitignore)). Or, I think you can put in `~/.config/.gitignore_global` if your prefer.

2. Visit [gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io) and generate yourself a recommended global gitignore file, given your preferred languages, code editor, and OS. For example, here's [one for writing Rust and Ruby in Vim on Linux](https://www.gitignore.io/api/vim,ruby,rust,linux):

```txt
# Created by https://www.gitignore.io/api/vim,ruby,rust,linux
# Edit at https://www.gitignore.io/?templates=vim,ruby,rust,linux

### Linux ###
*~

# temporary files which can be created if a process still has a handle open of a deleted file
.fuse_hidden*

# KDE directory preferences
.directory

# Linux trash folder which might appear on any partition or disk
.Trash-*

# .nfs files are created when an open file is removed but is still being accessed
.nfs*

### Ruby ###
*.gem
*.rbc
/.config
/coverage/
/InstalledFiles
/pkg/
/spec/reports/
/spec/examples.txt
/test/tmp/
/test/version_tmp/
/tmp/

# Used by dotenv library to load environment variables.
# .env

# Ignore Byebug command history file.
.byebug_history

## Specific to RubyMotion:
.dat*
.repl_history
build/
*.bridgesupport
build-iPhoneOS/
build-iPhoneSimulator/

## Specific to RubyMotion (use of CocoaPods):
#
# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:
# https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-check-the-pods-directory-into-source-control
# vendor/Pods/

## Documentation cache and generated files:
/.yardoc/
/_yardoc/
/doc/
/rdoc/

## Environment normalization:
/.bundle/
/vendor/bundle
/lib/bundler/man/

# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# Gemfile.lock
# .ruby-version
# .ruby-gemset

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc

### Rust ###
# Generated by Cargo
# will have compiled files and executables
/target/

# Remove Cargo.lock from gitignore if creating an executable, leave it for libraries
# More information here https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/cargo-toml-vs-cargo-lock.html
# Cargo.lock

# These are backup files generated by rustfmt
**/*.rs.bk

### Vim ###
# Swap
[._]*.s[a-v][a-z]
[._]*.sw[a-p]
[._]s[a-rt-v][a-z]
[._]ss[a-gi-z]
[._]sw[a-p]

# Session
Session.vim
Sessionx.vim

# Temporary
.netrwhist
# Auto-generated tag files
tags
# Persistent undo
[._]*.un~

# End of https://www.gitignore.io/api/vim,ruby,rust,linux
```
