# Images and Video

For editing RAW photos, try Darktable of DigiKam(?). Here are some [free film emulators](https://github.com/t3mujin/t3mujinpack) for DarkTable. 

For viewing video files, there's always trusty [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-ubuntu.html), which is available as a snap: `sudo snap install vlc`

There's also GIMP and, for editing video, Kdenlive.
