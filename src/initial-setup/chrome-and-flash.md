# Chrome and Flash

The best way to watch things that _might_ require Flash(?) like Hulu is to do it through the Chrome browser (not Chromium) 

[Download Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) and then install it (I forget the steps).

You _may_ need to also install some sort of flash plugin. In the past I've tried running: `sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer` and then restarting Chrome.

I've Googled and found blog posts like [this one](https://websiteforstudents.com/installing-the-latest-flash-player-on-ubuntu-17-10/) with other things to try.
